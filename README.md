## Testing
I have tested the web page with my mentor. Initially, I got some feedback and I made a little changes
- Make code more formatted.
- Reduce the comments.

I have tested the web page on different browsers and screen sizes and its works. My Contact form did not work really well at first,
so when submitting a form page could not refresh, but then after many search I found solution.
It works and refresh well and shows feedback message to users.
Have tested payment system <img src="./assets/images/swish_xs.png"> it works well and you can donate, which I have mentioned only in Sweden works.
Google map API It was a challenge to make two maps, two different addresses in the same page but thanks to <img src="./assets/images/codeinstitute.png"> and *Google* I fixed it.
